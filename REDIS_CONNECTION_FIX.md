# Redis Connection Problem Fixed

## Issue
The application was unable to connect to Redis, showing multiple "ECONNREFUSED" errors in the logs:

```
error: Redis client error: {"code":"ECONNREFUSED","module":"Redis","service":"crypto-price-alert"}
```

## Root Cause
The `npm run services:start` command reports Redis is running when it's actually not. The script only checks if the redis-server.exe process exists, but doesn't verify if it's properly listening on port 6380.

## Solution
The issue was that Redis wasn't properly starting when using the standard service start script. We fixed it by:

1. Stopping all services:
   ```powershell
   npm run services:stop
   ```

2. Using the fixed services script to start Redis and PostgreSQL:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Users\Nack\Documents\price-alert\portable-env\start-services-fix.ps1
   ```

3. Restarting the application:
   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

## Prevention
For future reference, always make sure Redis is actually running before starting the application. You can check using:

```powershell
netstat -an | findstr 6380
```

If Redis is running, you should see it listening on port 6380 (`127.0.0.1:6380 LISTENING`).

## Recommended Startup Procedure
1. Stop any existing services:
   ```powershell
   npm run services:stop
   ```

2. Use the fixed script to start services (this is more reliable than npm run services:start):
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Users\Nack\Documents\price-alert\portable-env\start-services-fix.ps1
   ```

3. Verify Redis is running properly:
   ```powershell
   netstat -an | findstr 6380
   ```
   You should see a line with `127.0.0.1:6380 LISTENING`

4. Start the application:
   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

This ensures the Redis and PostgreSQL services are properly running before the application attempts to connect to them.
